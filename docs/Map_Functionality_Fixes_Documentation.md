# Map Functionality Fixes Documentation

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. MapFragment Implementation Issue
**Problem**: The MapFragment was using a placeholder implementation that inflated the wrong layout (fragment_home instead of fragment_map).

**Fix**: Completely rewrote the MapFragment.java to properly implement OSMDroid map functionality:
- Properly inflates fragment_map.xml layout
- Initializes OSMDroid configuration
- Sets up map view with proper tile source (MAPNIK)
- Enables multitouch controls
- Centers map on Mecca with appropriate zoom level
- Adds important Hajj-related location markers

### 2. Missing Permissions
**Problem**: The AndroidManifest.xml was missing some required permissions for map functionality.

**Fix**: Added the following permissions:
- `ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION` - For location services
- `ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE` - For network connectivity checks

### 3. Map Markers Added
The following important Hajj locations have been added as markers on the map:

1. **Kaaba/Masjid al-Haram** (21.4225, 39.8262)
   - The holiest site in Islam
   
2. **Mount Arafat** (21.3544, 39.9857)
   - The most important day of Hajj
   
3. **Muzdalifah** (21.4067, 39.9364)
   - Sacred valley where pilgrims spend the night
   
4. **Mina** (21.4120, 39.8884)
   - City of tents - Jamarat location
   
5. **Masjid an-Nabawi** (24.4672, 39.6142)
   - Prophet's Mosque in Medina

## Technical Implementation Details

### MapFragment.java Changes
- Added proper imports for OSMDroid components
- Implemented onCreateView with full map initialization
- Added addHajjLocations() method to populate important locations
- Implemented proper lifecycle methods (onResume, onPause)
- Added permission handling framework

### AndroidManifest.xml Changes
- Added ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION permission
- Added ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE permission

## Dependencies
The project already includes the required OSMDroid dependency:
```gradle
implementation 'org.osmdroid:osmdroid-android:6.1.10'
```

## Layout Files
The fragment_map.xml layout was already properly configured with:
- FrameLayout container
- OSMDroid MapView with proper ID and dimensions

## Testing Notes
- The map will center on Mecca (Kaaba) when first loaded
- Users can zoom and pan the map using touch gestures
- Tapping on markers will show location names and descriptions
- The map uses OpenStreetMap tiles for detailed geographical information

## Future Enhancements
Potential improvements that could be added:
1. User location tracking
2. Route planning between Hajj sites
3. Offline map support
4. Additional points of interest
5. Prayer time integration based on location
6. Qibla direction indicator

## Build Requirements
- Android SDK 31 or higher
- Java 17 JDK
- Gradle 8.12 or compatible version
- Internet connection for map tiles
