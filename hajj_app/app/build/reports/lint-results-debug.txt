/home/ubuntu/hajj-app/hajj_app/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml:8: Warning: WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE is deprecated (and is not granted) when targeting Android 13+. If you need to write to shared storage, use the MediaStore.createWriteRequest intent. [ScopedStorage]
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
                                   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "ScopedStorage":
   Scoped storage is enforced on Android 10+ (or Android 11+ if using
   requestLegacyExternalStorage). In particular, WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE will
   no longer provide write access to all files; it will provide the equivalent
   of READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE instead.

   As of Android 13, if you need to query or interact with MediaStore or media
   files on the shared storage, you should be using instead one or more new
   storage permissions:
   * android.permission.READ_MEDIA_IMAGES
   * android.permission.READ_MEDIA_VIDEO
   * android.permission.READ_MEDIA_AUDIO

   and then add maxSdkVersion="33" to the older permission. See the developer
   guide for how to do this:
   https://developer.android.com/about/versions/13/behavior-changes-13#granula
   r-media-permissions

   The MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission can be used to manage all files, but
   it is rarely necessary and most apps on Google Play are not allowed to use
   it. Most apps should instead migrate to use scoped storage. To modify or
   delete files, apps should request write access from the user as described
   at https://goo.gle/android-mediastore-createwriterequest.

                                          ~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "DefaultLocale":
   Calling String#toLowerCase() or #toUpperCase() without specifying an
   explicit locale is a common source of bugs. The reason for that is that
   those methods will use the current locale on the user's device, and even
   though the code appears to work correctly when you are developing the app,
   it will fail in some locales. For example, in the Turkish locale, the
   uppercase replacement for i is not I.

   If you want the methods to just perform ASCII replacement, for example to
   convert an enum name, call String#toUpperCase(Locale.US) instead. If you
   really want to use the current locale, call
   String#toUpperCase(Locale.getDefault()) instead.

public class SplashActivity extends AppCompatActivity {
             ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "CustomSplashScreen":
   Starting in Android 12 (API 31+), the application's Launch Screen is
   provided by the system and the application should not create its own,
   otherwise the user will see two splashscreens. Please check the
   SplashScreen class to check how the Splash Screen can be controlled and
   customized.

                              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "GradleDependency":
   This detector looks for usages of libraries where the version you are using
   is not the current stable release. Using older versions is fine, and there
   are cases where you deliberately want to stick with an older version.
   However, you may simply not be aware that a more recent version is
   available, and that is what this lint check helps find.

/home/ubuntu/hajj-app/hajj_app/app/src/main/java/com/muslim/hajjrules/adapters/RuleAdapter.java:61: Warning: It will always be more efficient to use more specific change events if you can. Rely on notifyDataSetChanged as a last resort. [NotifyDataSetChanged]
        notifyDataSetChanged();
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "NotifyDataSetChanged":
   The RecyclerView adapter's onNotifyDataSetChanged method does not specify
   what about the data set has changed, forcing any observers to assume that
   all existing items and structure may no longer be valid. `LayoutManager`s
   will be forced to fully rebind and relayout all visible views.

/home/ubuntu/hajj-app/hajj_app/app/src/main/res/layout/activity_splash.xml:6: Warning: Possible overdraw: Root element paints background @color/white with a theme that also paints a background (inferred theme is @style/Theme.HajjApp) [Overdraw]
    android:background="@color/white">
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "Overdraw":
   If you set a background drawable on a root view, then you should use a
   custom theme where the theme background is null. Otherwise, the theme
   background will be painted first, only to have your custom background
   completely cover it; this is called "overdraw".

   NOTE: This detector relies on figuring out which layouts are associated
   with which activities based on scanning the Java code, and it's currently
   doing that using an inexact pattern matching algorithm. Therefore, it can
   incorrectly conclude which activity the layout is associated with and then
   wrongly complain that a background-theme is hidden.

   If you want your custom background on multiple pages, then you should
   consider making a custom theme with your custom background and just using
   that theme instead of a root element background.

   Of course it's possible that your custom drawable is translucent and you
   want it to be mixed with the background. However, you will get better
   performance if you pre-mix the background with your drawable and use that
   resulting image or color as a custom theme background instead.

   Explanation for issues of type "UnusedResources":
   Unused resources make applications larger and slow down builds.


   The unused resource check can ignore tests. If you want to include
   resources that are only referenced from tests, consider packaging them in a
   test source set instead.

   You can include test sources in the unused resource check by setting the
   system property lint.unused-resources.include-tests =true, and to exclude
   them (usually for performance reasons), use
   lint.unused-resources.exclude-tests =true.

/home/ubuntu/hajj-app/hajj_app/app/src/main/res/mipmap-xxxhdpi/ic_launcher.png: Warning: Launcher icons should not fill every pixel of their square region; see the design guide for details [IconLauncherShape]

   Explanation for issues of type "IconLauncherShape":
   According to the Android Design Guide
   (https://material.io/design/iconography/) your launcher icons should "use a
   distinct silhouette", a "three-dimensional, front view, with a slight
   perspective as if viewed from above, so that users perceive some depth."

   The unique silhouette implies that your launcher icon should not be a
   filled square.

/home/ubuntu/hajj-app/hajj_app/app/src/main/res/mipmap-xxxhdpi/ic_launcher.png: Warning: The image ic_launcher.png varies significantly in its density-independent (dip) size across the various density versions: mipmap-hdpi/ic_launcher.png: 683x683 dp (1024x1024 px), mipmap-xhdpi/ic_launcher.png: 512x512 dp (1024x1024 px), mipmap-xxhdpi/ic_launcher.png: 341x341 dp (1024x1024 px), mipmap-xxxhdpi/ic_launcher.png: 256x256 dp (1024x1024 px) [IconDipSize]

   Explanation for issues of type "IconDipSize":
   Checks the all icons which are provided in multiple densities, all compute
   to roughly the same density-independent pixel (dip) size. This catches
   errors where images are either placed in the wrong folder, or icons are
   changed to new sizes but some folders are forgotten.

/home/ubuntu/hajj-app/hajj_app/app/src/main/res/mipmap-xxxhdpi/ic_launcher.png: Warning: The ic_launcher.png icon has identical contents in the following configuration folders: mipmap-hdpi, mipmap-xhdpi, mipmap-xxhdpi, mipmap-xxxhdpi [IconDuplicatesConfig]

   Explanation for issues of type "IconDuplicatesConfig":
   If an icon is provided under different configuration parameters such as
   drawable-hdpi or -v11, they should typically be different. This detector
   catches cases where the same icon is provided in different configuration
   folder which is usually not intentional.

   Explanation for issues of type "IconLocation":
   The res/drawable folder is intended for density-independent graphics such
   as shapes defined in XML. For bitmaps, move it to drawable-mdpi and
   consider providing higher and lower resolution versions in drawable-ldpi,
   drawable-hdpi and drawable-xhdpi. If the icon really is density independent
   (for example a solid color) you can place it in drawable-nodpi.

/home/ubuntu/hajj-app/hajj_app/app/src/main/res/layout/activity_splash.xml:8: Warning: Missing contentDescription attribute on image [ContentDescription]
    <ImageView
     ~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "ContentDescription":
   Non-textual widgets like ImageViews and ImageButtons should use the
   contentDescription attribute to specify a textual description of the widget
   such that screen readers and other accessibility tools can adequately
   describe the user interface.

   Note that elements in application screens that are purely decorative and do
   not provide any content or enable a user action should not have
   accessibility content descriptions. In this case, set their descriptions to
   @null. If your app's minSdkVersion is 16 or higher, you can instead set
   these graphical elements' android:importantForAccessibility attributes to
   no.

   Note that for text fields, you should not set both the hint and the
   contentDescription attributes since the hint will never be shown. Just set
   the hint.
